- **Placeholder examples** only (example-user, ghp_xxxx...)
- **Security warnings** prominently displayed
- **Regular updates** to reflect current implementation

## ðŸ”„ Keeping Documentation Current

Documentation is updated with each development session:
1. Technical changes reflected in specifications
