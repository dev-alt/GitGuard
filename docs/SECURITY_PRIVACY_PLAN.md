# Security and Privacy Plan

## Security Architecture

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Request minimal GitHub API permissions required
- Read-only access to repositories and commit history
- No write permissions to repositories
- No access to organization secrets or private user data

### Credential Security

#### Authentication Options
1. **GitHub Personal Access Token (Recommended)**
   - Token-based authentication with scoped permissions
   - No password storage required
   - Easy revocation and rotation
   - Support for fine-grained tokens

2. **Username/Password (Legacy)**
   - Immediate authentication without token setup
   - Requires secure storage mechanisms
   - Subject to 2FA requirements

#### Secure Storage
- **System Keyring Integration**: Use OS-native credential storage (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service)
- **Memory Protection**: Clear credentials from memory after use
- **No Plaintext Storage**: Never store credentials in configuration files or logs
- **Session Management**: Implement session timeouts and automatic logout

### Data Protection

#### In-Transit Security
- All GitHub API communications over HTTPS/TLS
- Certificate validation and pinning
- Secure WebSocket connections for real-time updates

#### At-Rest Security
- Encrypted local cache (optional)
- Temporary file cleanup
- Secure deletion of sensitive data
- No sensitive data in application logs

#### Processing Security
- In-memory processing of sensitive content
- Automatic cleanup of temporary data structures
- Secure string handling to prevent memory dumps

### Application Security

#### Input Validation
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Validate GitHub usernames and repository names
- Secure regex pattern compilation
- Protection against regex DoS attacks

#### Error Handling
- No sensitive data in error messages
- Secure logging practices
- Graceful degradation without information disclosure
- Rate limiting protection

#### Code Security
- Static analysis integration
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Regular security updates
- Secure coding practices

## Privacy Protection

### Data Minimization
- Process only necessary repository data
- Skip binary and non-text files
- Limit commit history depth (configurable)
- Exclude irrelevant file types automatically

### User Control
- Clear consent for data processing
- Granular repository selection
- Opt-in for caching mechanisms
- User-controlled data retention periods

### Data Processing Transparency
- Clear indication of what data is being processed
- Real-time progress reporting
- Detailed logging of scan activities (without sensitive content)
- User access to processing logs

### No External Data Transmission
- All processing performed locally
- No cloud-based analysis or storage
- No telemetry or usage analytics
- No automatic updates without user consent

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR Compliance (EU Users)
- Clear privacy notice and consent
- Right to data portability (export features)
- Right to erasure (data deletion)
- Data processing lawfulness basis

### Security Standards
- Follow OWASP secure coding guidelines
- Implement security by design principles
- Regular security assessment and testing
- Vulnerability disclosure process

## Threat Model

### Identified Threats

#### T1: Credential Theft
- **Risk**: Stored credentials accessed by malware
- **Mitigation**: System keyring integration, encryption at rest
- **Detection**: Unusual API access patterns

#### T2: Man-in-the-Middle Attacks
- **Risk**: Interception of GitHub API communications
- **Mitigation**: Certificate pinning, TLS verification
- **Detection**: Certificate validation failures

#### T3: Data Exfiltration
- **Risk**: Sensitive scan results accessed by unauthorized parties
- **Mitigation**: Local-only processing, secure file permissions
- **Detection**: File system monitoring alerts

#### T4: Malicious Repository Content
- **Risk**: Crafted repository content causing application vulnerabilities
- **Mitigation**: Input sanitization, sandboxed processing
- **Detection**: Anomaly detection in scan results

#### T5: Dependency Vulnerabilities
- **Risk**: Third-party library vulnerabilities
- **Mitigation**: Regular dependency updates, vulnerability scanning
- **Detection**: Automated security scanning

### Attack Surface Analysis

#### Network Interface
- GitHub API endpoints only
- No listening services or open ports
- TLS-only communications

#### File System Access
- Read access to user-selected cache directories
- Write access to export/report locations only
- No system-wide file access

#### System Resources
- Memory usage monitoring and limits
- CPU usage throttling during intensive scans
- Temporary file cleanup

## Security Controls

### Access Controls
- User authentication required for all operations
- Role-based access within application (viewer/administrator)
- Audit logging of all user actions
- Session management and timeout

### Encryption
- AES-256 encryption for cached sensitive data
- Secure random number generation for session tokens
- Hash-based integrity verification
- Key derivation from user credentials

### Monitoring and Logging
- Security event logging (authentication, errors)
- Performance monitoring and alerting
- Anomaly detection in scan patterns
- Audit trail for compliance

### Incident Response
- Automatic credential revocation on suspicious activity
- Error recovery and safe failure modes
- User notification system for security events
- Forensic logging capabilities

## Privacy Notice Template

### Information We Process
- GitHub repository metadata (names, URLs, descriptions)
- Commit history and file contents for security analysis
- User-provided authentication credentials
- Application usage patterns and preferences

### How We Process Information
- Local analysis only, no cloud processing
- Automated pattern matching for security vulnerabilities
- Temporary caching for performance optimization
- Export functionality for user-controlled reporting

### Information Sharing
- No sharing with third parties
- No telemetry or analytics transmission
- Local processing and storage only
- User has full control over all data

### User Rights
- View all processed data through export functions
- Delete all application data and caches
- Control scope of repository scanning
- Revoke access permissions at any time
