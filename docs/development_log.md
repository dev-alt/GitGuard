# GitGuard Development Log

## Session 1: Initial Project Setup and Planning

**User Request**: "I want to create a program that checks my github and all my commit history for any thing like .env files, or usernames/passwords or any seneattive information it should have a simple gui where the user enters their git user/pass lets start plannign the documetnation for this app"

**Claude's Interpretation**: User wants a GitHub security scanner desktop application with GUI for detecting sensitive information in repositories and commit history.

   - Development rules prevent accidental credential commits

3. **Application Design Security**:
   - Local-only processing design
   - System keyring integration planned
   - Minimal GitHub API permissions required
   - Secure credential handling architecture

4. **Development Process Security**:
   - Mandatory security review before every commit
   - Testing with synthetic data only
   - No real repository data in development
   - Clear separation between example and production data

---

### Next Steps Planned:

1. **Create repository structure**: Source directories and example files
2. **Implement core modules**: Authentication, scanning, detection engines
3. **Develop GUI interface**: Tkinter-based user interface
4. **Add pattern detection**: Implement regex-based secret detection
5. **Create reporting system**: Export functionality for scan results
6. **Testing and validation**: Comprehensive testing with synthetic data
7. **Documentation updates**: Keep README and docs current with implementation

---

### Key Design Decisions:

1. **Technology Stack**: Python + Tkinter chosen for simplicity and cross-platform compatibility
2. **Security First**: Local-only processing, no external data transmission
3. **User Control**: Granular repository selection and data retention control
4. **Pattern Database**: 120+ industry-standard detection patterns
5. **Modular Design**: Separate modules for authentication, scanning, detection, GUI, reporting

This session established a solid foundation for GitGuard development with comprehensive planning, security considerations, and development infrastructure.
