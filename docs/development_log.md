# GitGuard Development Log

## Session 1: Initial Project Setup and Planning

**User Request**: "I want to create a program that checks my github and all my commit history for any thing like .env files, or usernames/passwords or any seneattive information it should have a simple gui where the user enters their git user/pass lets start plannign the documetnation for this app"

**Claude's Interpretation**: User wants a GitHub security scanner desktop application with GUI for detecting sensitive information in repositories and commit history.

### Tasks Completed:

1. ✅ **Research and document security scanning requirements**
   - Researched existing GitHub security scanning tools (GitGuardian, Bearer CLI, SentinelOne, etc.)
   - Identified key detection patterns and methodologies
   - Documented industry best practices for secret scanning

2. ✅ **Plan application architecture and technology stack**
   - Selected Python with Tkinter for cross-platform GUI
   - Chose PyGithub for GitHub API integration
   - Planned modular architecture (auth, scanner, detection, GUI, reporting)
   - Researched GUI framework options (Tkinter vs PyQt6 vs Kivy)

3. ✅ **Design user interface mockups and workflow**
   - Created ASCII-art GUI layout mockups
   - Designed authentication flow with token and password options
   - Planned repository selection interface
   - Designed scan progress indication and results display

4. ✅ **Document sensitive data patterns to detect**
   - Researched 120+ regex patterns for API keys, tokens, passwords
   - Identified high-risk file types (.env, config files, private keys)
   - Documented entropy analysis and machine learning approaches
   - Created comprehensive pattern database from industry sources

5. ✅ **Create technical specification document**
   - Comprehensive 200+ line technical specification
   - Detailed architecture with all modules (auth.py, scanner.py, detection.py, gui.py, reporting.py)
   - Specific regex patterns for major secret types
   - GUI design with tab-based interface
   - Performance requirements and error handling
   - Testing strategy and deployment plans

6. ✅ **Plan security and privacy considerations**
   - Detailed security architecture with principle of least privilege
   - Credential protection using system keyring
   - Local-only processing with no external data transmission
   - GDPR compliance considerations
   - Comprehensive threat model and mitigation strategies
   - Privacy protection and user control features

7. ✅ **Brainstorm application names**
   - Generated multiple name options (GitGuard, RepoSentinel, SecretSeeker, etc.)
   - Recommended "GitGuard" for clarity and professionalism

8. ✅ **Generate SSH keys for git repository**
   - Created ED25519 SSH key pair: `/root/.ssh/gitguard_ed25519`
   - Generated public key: `ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIHxU6EThzG2DxaHdbRMzjZKPQs+C2vDZ29Mk0ZAYuU7B gitguard-project`
   - Ready for GitHub repository setup

9. ✅ **Adapt development rules from previous project**
   - Created GitGuard-specific development rules adapted from Smart Log Analyser project
   - Enhanced security considerations for GitHub scanning application
   - Added GitGuard-specific security patterns and exclusions
   - Created comprehensive .gitignore with security-focused patterns

10. ✅ **Initialize git repository structure**
    - Initialized git repository and renamed default branch to 'main'
    - Created comprehensive .gitignore with security-focused exclusions
    - Created detailed README.md with installation, usage, and security guidelines
    - Established development log for tracking progress

---

### Files Created:

**Planning Documents:**
- `TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md` - Complete technical architecture and requirements
- `SECURITY_PRIVACY_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive security and privacy framework

**Development Infrastructure:**
- `DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md` - GitGuard-specific development guidelines
- `.gitignore` - Security-focused git exclusions
- `README.md` - User-facing documentation and installation guide
- `.development_log.md` - This development tracking document

**Repository Setup:**
- Initialized git repository with 'main' branch
- Generated SSH keys for secure repository access

---

### Security Considerations:

1. **Documentation Security**:
   - All examples use placeholder values (example-user, ghp_xxxx...)
   - No real GitHub usernames or tokens in any documentation
   - Security warnings prominently displayed in README

2. **Git Security**:
   - Comprehensive .gitignore excludes all sensitive data patterns
   - SSH keys, tokens, scan results, and cache directories excluded
   - Development rules prevent accidental credential commits

3. **Application Design Security**:
   - Local-only processing design
   - System keyring integration planned
   - Minimal GitHub API permissions required
   - Secure credential handling architecture

4. **Development Process Security**:
   - Mandatory security review before every commit
   - Testing with synthetic data only
   - No real repository data in development
   - Clear separation between example and production data

---

### Next Steps Planned:

1. **Create repository structure**: Source directories and example files
2. **Implement core modules**: Authentication, scanning, detection engines
3. **Develop GUI interface**: Tkinter-based user interface
4. **Add pattern detection**: Implement regex-based secret detection
5. **Create reporting system**: Export functionality for scan results
6. **Testing and validation**: Comprehensive testing with synthetic data
7. **Documentation updates**: Keep README and docs current with implementation

---

### Key Design Decisions:

1. **Technology Stack**: Python + Tkinter chosen for simplicity and cross-platform compatibility
2. **Security First**: Local-only processing, no external data transmission
3. **User Control**: Granular repository selection and data retention control
4. **Pattern Database**: 120+ industry-standard detection patterns
5. **Modular Design**: Separate modules for authentication, scanning, detection, GUI, reporting

This session established a solid foundation for GitGuard development with comprehensive planning, security considerations, and development infrastructure.
