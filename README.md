# GitGuard - GitHub Security Scanner

A desktop GUI application for scanning GitHub repositories and commit history to detect sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, tokens, environment files, and other security vulnerabilities.

## ðŸš¨ Security Notice

**GitGuard is a defensive security tool designed to help users identify accidentally committed sensitive information in their own repositories. Never use this tool to scan repositories you don't own or have explicit permission to analyze.**

## Features

- **Comprehensive Scanning**: Analyzes entire repository history including all commits
- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies 120+ types of sensitive data patterns
- **Simple GUI**: User-friendly Tkinter interface with authentication and results display
- **Local Processing**: All scanning performed locally - no data transmitted to external services
- **Export Options**: Generate reports in CSV, JSON, and PDF formats
- **Risk Assessment**: Automatic risk scoring for discovered findings

## Detected Sensitive Data Types

### API Keys & Tokens
- AWS Access Keys (`AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}`)
- GitHub Personal Access Tokens (`ghp_[a-zA-Z0-9]{36}`)
- Generic API Keys and Tokens
- OAuth Tokens and Bearer Tokens

### Database Credentials
- Connection strings (MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Database passwords and usernames
- Connection URLs with embedded credentials

### Private Keys & Certificates
- RSA Private Keys (`-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`)
- SSH Private Keys (`-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----`)
- PGP Private Keys
- SSL/TLS Certificates

### Environment Variables

- Database configuration files

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git (for repository cloning)
- GitHub account with appropriate permissions

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dev-alt/GitGuard.git
cd GitGuard
```

2. **Create virtual environment:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```

## Usage

### Starting the Application

```bash
# Method 1: Using main entry point (recommended)
python main.py

# Method 2: Direct GUI launch  
python src/gui.py
```

### Authentication Options

#### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)
1. Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token at https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Grant minimal read permissions: `repo` (for private repos) or `public_repo` (for public only)
3. Enter the token in GitGuard's authentication form

#### Option 2: Username/Password
1. Enter your GitHub username and password
2. Handle 2FA prompts if enabled
3. **Note**: Password authentication may be deprecated by GitHub

### Scanning Process

1. **Authenticate**: Enter your GitHub credentials
2. **Select Repositories**: Choose which repositories to scan
3. **Start Scan**: Begin the security analysis
4. **Review Results**: Examine findings with risk assessments
5. **Export Reports**: Generate detailed reports for documentation

## Security and Privacy

### Data Protection
- **Local Processing Only**: All scanning performed on your machine
- **No External Transmission**: No data sent to external services
- **Secure Credential Storage**: Optional integration with system keyring
- **Memory Protection**: Sensitive data cleared from memory after use

### GitHub API Usage
- **Minimal Permissions**: Requests only necessary read access
- **Rate Limit Compliance**: Respects GitHub API rate limits
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API errors and timeouts

### Privacy Features
- **User Control**: Complete control over what repositories are scanned
- **Data Retention**: User-controlled data retention and deletion
- **No Telemetry**: No usage analytics or telemetry data collected

## Configuration

### Example Configuration Files

**github_config.json.example**:
```json
{
    "username": "your-github-username",
    "token": "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "api_url": "https://api.github.com",
    "timeout": 30,
    "max_repos": 100
}
```

**Custom Pattern Configuration**:
```json
{
    "custom_patterns": [
        {
            "name": "Internal API Key",
            "pattern": "INTERNAL_API_[A-Za-z0-9]{32}",
            "risk_level": "HIGH",
            "description": "Internal API key pattern"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Errors:**
- Verify your GitHub token has correct permissions
- Check for 2FA requirements
- Ensure token is not expired

**Rate Limiting:**
- GitGuard respects GitHub API limits automatically
- Consider using authenticated requests for higher limits
- Large repositories may require multiple API calls

**Performance Issues:**
- Large repositories (10,000+ commits) may take several minutes
- Consider scanning specific date ranges for very large repos
- Monitor memory usage during large scans
